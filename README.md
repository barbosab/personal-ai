# Pythia AI

Pythia, the high priestess of the Oracle of Delphi, was believed to channel divine answers to the questions of those seeking guidance. Similarly, this project's goal is to develop a personal AI that runs locally in an Electron app and can be customized for individual use, providing answers to all of a person’s questions.

## Open Source Projects Pythia Relies On

Pythia depends on several open-source projects to function. While this doesn’t list every npm package used, it highlights the major ones.

- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)
- [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)
- [MUI](https://mui.com/)
- Special thanks to [chatd](https://github.com/BruceMacD/chatd), which was used as an example of how to embed Ollama in an Electron app.
